    Required Argument:
    hand   - `protocards.standard.StandardHand`; the hand to count.

    Optional Arguments:
    turned - `protocards.standard.StandardCard`; the turned card. Will be
             included in scoring if given, and can provide heels and
             nobs points.
    crib   - Boolean; whether to score this hand as a crib. Flushes in
             crib hands only count if they include the turned card.
             Defaults to `False` and ignored if no turned card given.
    dealer - Boolean; whether to score this hand as the dealer's. Only
             the dealer can earn points for heels. Defaults to `False`
             and ignored if no turned card given.

    Returns a dictionary whose keys are the types of score ("fifteens",
    "pairs", "runs", "flush", "heels", and "nobs") and whose values are
